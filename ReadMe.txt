This project is the main development project made on Xilinx ISE 14.7 in which each equation is implemented
and then tested.

In order to simulate a particular module, you need to locate the corresponding test bench (usually module_name_tb.v)
and then run Behavioural Simulation. 

This is not the final submission.
